## Reduced instruction set machine learning

Picard is a Python package with thorough eductional reference implementations of many common programs used for machine learning and scientific computing. Picard is a piece of educational software in the sense that the implementation is designed to maximize pedagogical objectives, as opposed to objectives related to performance or reliability. Below I list the "instruction set" (a small set of primitive functions) that Picard derives from.

Finally, Picard contains a set of illustrative examples of the code in use on a set of applications in science and computing: 
  * Evolutionary genetics simulation 
  * Computer vision applied to autonomous driving 
  * Robotics reverse dynamics problem 

then wrapped in high level routines which foster short example use-case scripts with accompanying visuals using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 

The implementations provided in Picard cohere with the associated text; Ruye Wang's _Machine Learning: From Theory to Code_, an upcoming book for senior undergraduates in mathematics, engineering, and computing. The book is scheduled to be available through Cambridge University Press in 2021.
