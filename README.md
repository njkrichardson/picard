## Pedagogical NumPy for Scientific Computing and Machine Learning

The picard package implements a number of standard methods used in scientific computing and machine learning. Methods are generally implemented using Python's dominant numerical computing library [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), then wrapped in high level routines which foster short example use-case scripts with accompanying visuals using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 

The implementations provided in picard are not intended to be faithful to large scale resource-aware development strategies, but rather with the aim of aligning coherently with the associated text; Ruye Wang's _Machine Learning: From Theory to Code_, an upcoming book for senior undergraduates in mathematics, engineering, and computing. The book is scheduled to be available through Cambridge University Press in 2021.
